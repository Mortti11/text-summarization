# Text Summarization Project

Welcome to the Text Summarization Project! This project is designed to create concise summaries from longer pieces of dialogue or text, making it easier to understand the main ideas without going through all the details.

## Overview

Text summarization is a useful tool for quickly grasping the key points of a conversation, article, or any other form of text. This project leverages machine learning to automatically generate summaries that capture the essence of the original content.

## Example

Let's consider an example:

### Original Dialogue:
- **John**: Hey! I've been thinking about getting a PlayStation 5. Do you think it is worth it?
- **Dan**: Idk man. R u sure ur going to have enough free time to play it?
- **John**: Yeah, that's why I'm not sure if I should buy one or not. I've been working so much lately idk if I'm gonna be able to play it as much as I'd like.

### Model-Generated Summary:
- "Dan and John have been talking about whether or not they should buy a new PlayStation."

This example demonstrates how the model can take a casual conversation and condense it into a brief summary that captures the main topic discussed.

## How It Works

The project uses a machine learning model to read and summarize text. Here’s how the process works:

1. **Input Text**: You provide the dialogue or text that needs summarizing.

2. **Preprocessing**: The text is cleaned up, removing any unnecessary elements to make it easier for the model to understand.

3. **Summarization**: The model processes the cleaned text and generates a summary, aiming to convey the main ideas in a shorter form.

4. **Output**: The summary is presented, providing a quick overview of the original content.

## How to Use This Project

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by downloading the project files from GitHub to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mortti11/text-summarization.git
   ```

2. **Install the Required Libraries**: Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary libraries using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**: Open the project in Jupyter Notebook or another Python environment. You can input your own dialogues or texts and generate summaries.

## Conclusion

This project is ideal for anyone who needs to quickly understand conversations or written content without reading through every detail. It’s useful for summarizing meetings, articles, or any text-based data.
